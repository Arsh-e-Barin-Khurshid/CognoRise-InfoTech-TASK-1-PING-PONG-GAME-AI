# Ping Pong Game
 




## 1. Project Overview

The Ping Pong Game is an engaging arcade-style game developed as part of Task 1 for Cognorise Infotech. This project incorporates classic ping pong gameplay where players compete to score points by bouncing a ball back and forth using paddles. The game leverages Java for its core logic and functionality, while HTML and CSS are used to structure and style the game's interface. The aim is to create a fun and interactive experience with a balance of challenge and enjoyment.


 





##  2. Features

This Ping Pong Game boasts several key features to enhance the gaming experience. Players can enjoy a traditional ping pong match with smooth paddle and ball mechanics. An AI opponent provides an additional challenge with adjustable difficulty levels. The game includes a chances system, giving each player a limited number of opportunities to win before the game concludes. The ball's speed increases incrementally each time it hits a paddle, adding a dynamic element to the gameplay. Players can also pause and resume the game without losing progress, and the interface includes intuitive buttons for starting, pausing, restarting, and exiting the game.





## 3. Technologies Used

The game is built using a combination of technologies to deliver a seamless experience. Java is used for the core game logic, handling the movement of the ball, paddle interactions, and game mechanics. HTML structures the game's user interface, ensuring that all elements are properly displayed. CSS is employed to style the game, including the background, paddles, ball, and buttons, creating an aesthetically pleasing and functional interface.




## 4. Usage

Starting the game is straightforward: click the 'Start' button to begin playing. If you need to pause the game, click the 'Pause' button, which will halt the gameplay while preserving your progress. To reset the game state, click the 'Restart' button, which will restart the game from the beginning. If you wish to exit the game and return to the title screen, click the 'Exit' button. These controls provide an intuitive way to manage the game flow.






## 5. Game Controls

The primary control for the game is mouse movement, which allows players to move the paddle up and down. This control is crucial for positioning the paddle to hit the ball effectively. If keyboard controls are applicable, they would be used to interact with the game similarly, but the primary input method remains the mouse.




## 6. Code Structure

The project is organized into several key files. index.html serves as the main HTML file, defining the structure and layout of the game interface. styles.css contains the CSS rules that style the various elements of the game, such as the background color, paddle appearance, and button styles. game.js is the JavaScript file where the core game logic resides, including the functions for rendering the game, handling user input, and updating the game state.


## 7. Customization

Customizing the game involves modifying various aspects to fit personal preferences or project requirements. To change the color scheme, edit the color values in styles.css. For adjustments to the ball and paddle speed, tweak the speed parameters in game.js. If you wish to alter the difficulty of the AI opponent, adjust the AI difficulty settings in the game.js file. These customizations allow you to tailor the game to your liking.





## 8. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the game, here are a few troubleshooting tips. If the game does not start, check that all files are correctly linked and look for any console errors that may indicate missing resources. For issues with paddle movement, verify that the mouse event listeners are correctly implemented and functioning. If the ball speed seems too fast or too slow, adjust the speed parameters in game.js to fine-tune the gameplay experience.
